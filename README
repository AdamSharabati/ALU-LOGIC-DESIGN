Overview
This VHDL code implements a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with four different operations. 
The ALU is designed to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two 4-bit integer inputs. 
The result of the operation and status flags are output from the ALU.

Entity Description
Ports
A: in integer range 0 to 15
The first 4-bit integer input for the ALU. Values should be in the range of 0 to 15.

B: in integer range 0 to 15
The second 4-bit integer input for the ALU. Values should be in the range of 0 to 15.

OP: in std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)
The operation selector input. Determines which arithmetic or logic operation to perform. The possible values and their corresponding operations are:

"00": Addition (A + B)
"01": Subtraction (A - B)
"10": Multiplication (A * B)
"11": Division (A / B)
Qout: out integer range 0 to 15
The result of the operation. The output will be in the range of 0 to 15.

z: out std_logic
Zero flag. Set to '1' if the result of the operation is zero, otherwise set to '0'.

c: out std_logic
Carry flag. Set to '1' if there is a carry-out from the addition or if there is a borrow in the subtraction or division; otherwise, set to '0'.

Functionality
Addition (OP = "00")
Operation: A + B
Carry (c): '1' if the result is greater than 15, indicating an overflow. '0' otherwise.
Zero (z): '1' if the result is zero, '0' otherwise.
Subtraction (OP = "01")
Operation: A - B
Carry (c): '1' if the result is negative (i.e., if A < B). '0' otherwise.
Zero (z): '1' if the result is zero, '0' otherwise.
Multiplication (OP = "10")
Operation: A * B
Carry (c): '1' if the result exceeds 15 (i.e., if A * B > 15). '0' otherwise.
Zero (z): '1' if the result is zero, '0' otherwise.
Division (OP = "11")
Operation: A / B
Carry (c): '1' if B is zero (to avoid division by zero). '0' otherwise.
Zero (z): '1' if the result is zero, '0' otherwise.
Example
Inputs: A = 7, B = 5, OP = "00"
Operation: Addition
Output: Qout = 12, c = '0', z = '0'

Inputs: A = 3, B = 5, OP = "01"
Operation: Subtraction
Output: Qout = 12 (since the output is unsigned, underflow is not shown here), c = '1', z = '0'

Inputs: A = 3, B = 5, OP = "10"
Operation: Multiplication
Output: Qout = 15, c = '0', z = '0'

Inputs: A = 6, B = 3, OP = "11"
Operation: Division
Output: Qout = 2, c = '0', z = '0'

Notes
Ensure that the input values for A and B are within the valid range (0 to 15).
